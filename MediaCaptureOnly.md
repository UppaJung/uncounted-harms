# Commissions Corrupt Coverage

<!-- To grasp the severity of the problem consider the analog of pharmaceuticals. -->
Would you trust newspapers that promote potentially-hazardous products with headlines like ‘Why You Need an Antidepressant. Yes, You’?

What if those articles quoted only those working in the industry that produces antidepressants?

And what if those newspapers received a commission each time readers bought antidepressants?

This is how tech products are covered today. The New York Times WireCutter has, in fact, published an article with the headline [‘Why You Need a Password Manager. Yes, You’](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/27/smarter-living/wirecutter/why-you-need-a-password-manager-yes-you.html); CNET has implored [‘Yes, You Need a Password Manager. Your Online Security Depends on It’](https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/yes-you-need-a-password-manager-your-online-security-depends-on-it/); Engadget has urged [‘You need a password manager -- right now’](https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-26-the-best-password-managers-compared.html); and for readers who might tempted to use the free password manager built into their browser, PCWorld has explained [‘Why your browser’s password manager isn’t good enough’](https://www.pcworld.com/article/393979/why-your-browsers-password-manager-isnt-good-enough.html).

All these news organizations receive commissions from the sellers of password managers when readers click on the links to buy them.[^nyt-affiliate-links-are-indirect]

[^nyt-affiliate-links-are-indirect]: The New York Times WireCutter's [‘Why You Need a Password Manager. Yes, You’](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/27/smarter-living/wirecutter/why-you-need-a-password-manager-yes-you.html) does not have direct affiliate links, but directs readers to another of their articles, [‘The Best Password Managers’](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-password-managers/) which contains purchasing links. Similarly, CNET's [‘Yes, You Need a Password Manager. Your Online Security Depends on It’](https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/yes-you-need-a-password-manager-your-online-security-depends-on-it/) links to their [rankings of the password managers](https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/best-password-manager/) with purchasing links that pay commissions. Engadget and PCWorld embedded affiliate links directly into the articles promoting the product category.

Tech products can indeed be hazardous, and those harmed include those who LastPass as their password manager after reading such articles. In 2022 attackers breached the servers operated by LastPass that stored all of their users' password databases. The breach led to additional harm because LastPass failed to fully encrypt users' databases, the encryption they did use to protect the passwords was woefully substandard, as a security researcher had revealed in 2018.[^lastpass-iterations] Some users had all of their passwords compromised. All were instructed to stop what they were doing and take the time to replace every single one of their passwords in case they might be compromised.

LastPass had been widely recommended, including by The New York Times[^nyt-lastpass-rec], was ranked by PCWorld as ‘Best Overall’ and by CNET as ‘Best paid password manager’, and had accumulated one of the largest shares of the password manager market, if not *the* largest.[^lastpass-market-share] Articles continued to recommend LastPass even after an earlier breach in 2015 and even after LastPass repeatedly disregarded and failed to fix flaws identified by security researchers.  The products' security shortcomings seemed to have no effect on its ratings.

[^nyt-lastpass-rec]: The free edition of LastPass was recommended by The New York Times WireCutter prior its developer's acquisition by private equity in 2020.

The news organizations that recommend products they receive commissions for claim to editorial independence. They argued that they can be trusted because editorial staff are “generally unaware” of the commission earned from each product.[^editorial-independence] This might eliminate bias between products, especially since when most products pay commissions, the article will earn money regardless which is recommended. The bias of concern is not that which would favor a product within a product category, but in favor of entire product categories.

For lucrative product categories commissions create a bias towards more coverage and towards coverage biased in favor of the decision to purchase a product in the category over the alternative of not purchasing any product. Commissions discourage investigation into potential product harms, which reduce enthusiasm even for those products within a category that best safeguarded against those harms, and so reduce commissions from the entire category. Commissions can allow industries to capture the media that should be holding them to account. It's no coincidence that there are so many news organizations ranking password managers, each replete with an explanation of why you should use one, and without much coverage of potential harms.

<!-- See, for example, pressure cookers with escape valves. -->

To restore our trust, news organizations must end their willful ignorance of the harms of accepting commissions. They should either stop accepting them entirely or, failing that, voluntarily disclose all money changing hands and acknowledge the full range of potential biases that result. Journalists should investigate the money flows that have not been voluntarily disclosed. They can start with what may have been tens of millions of dollars received each year by those who published articles recommending LastPass.[^money-flow]

[^editorial-independence]: The New York Times WireCutter [partnerships page](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/partners/) claims a “strict separation between Commerce and Editorial” and the [about page](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/about/) claims “total editorial independence”. PCWorld, a product of IDG Communications Inc., claims “editorial independence” because [“Our journalists are generally unaware of how much commission – if any – PCWorld receives from a purchase.”](https://www.pcworld.com/about/affiliate-link-policy) Even [Consumer Reports](https://www.consumerreports.org/), the gold standard in product coverage that insists on buying the products it reviews and touts being “Ad-free. Influence-free. Powered by consumers.”, collects affiliate commissions, including via their links to recommended password managers. While LastPass was not among their recommendations for 2023-05-12, their review of LastPass still rated it “Excellent in data security” despite all the evidence to the contrary.


[^lastpass-market-share]: In a 2021 [study](https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/37374029) co-authored with collaborators at UC Berkeley, LastPass had the largest market share among verified participants.

[^lastpass-iterations]: See Wladimir Palant's 2018 [Is your LastPass data really safe in the encrypted online vault?](https://palant.info/2018/07/09/is-your-lastpass-data-really-safe-in-the-encrypted-online-vault/) and post-breach article [LastPass breach: The significance of these password iterations](https://palant.info/2022/12/28/lastpass-breach-the-significance-of-these-password-iterations/),

[^lastpass-best]: Contact me for archival copies of both articles if necessary. At the time of writing, the [PCWorld article](https://www.pcworld.com/article/393979/why-your-browsers-password-manager-isnt-good-enough.html) was still online with the recommendation unchanged and the [CNET article was available via the Internet Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20210707100536/https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/best-password-manager/).

[^wired-notes-security]: To the credit of Wired, author Lily Hay Newman did mention as early as [2018](https://web.archive.org/web/20200612063257/https://www.wired.com/story/password-manager-autofill-ad-tech-privacy/) that “The main drawback to LastPass is its mixed security track record—the product has had a number of high-profile, critical bugs and there have even been some data breaches. Overall, LastPass has weathered these storms, but it's worth noting.”

[^money-flow]: The final [SEC Form 10-Q for the six months ending June 30, 2020 of LogMeIn](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001420302/000156459020034298/logm-10q_20200630.htm), the developer of LastPass, reported sales and marketing expenses of \$235.5 million, of which \$92.2 million were bucketed as marketing expenses separate from the sales and marketing personnel, professional services, credit card transaction fees, and so on (the other \$127.7 million). The SEC report does not break down these expenses between LogMeIn's flagship LastPass and other products, and between affiliate commissions and direct advertising. Yet, even if LastPass commissions represented 10\% of that budget, it would mean that over ten million dollars flowed between this one product vendor and the media covering that vendor in the year before the breach alone.
