# Media Capture and the Hazards of Security Products

When security products and features backfire they can cause us devastating and irreparable harm. When we are locked out of online or encrypted storage, we can permanently lose decades of photos, correspondence, and records. Even temporary denials of access can cause permanent harm, such as when they prevent us from sharing important medical data before emergency treatment, from reaching out to those we trust when we need them most, or from being reached by others when they need us most. The potential for harm grows ss we grow ever more reliant on technology to unlock the world around us and help us navigate it.

Yet the tech industry presents security as a tradeoff between harm and inconvenience: where stricter security prevents harms at the cost of mere *inconvenience*. The language implies that those unwilling to make this tradeoff are irresponsible, even when the costs are unmeasured and unknown. The industry has captured the press to promote and amplify this narrative.

The tech industry would readily fault us for the harms we face when the security measures that are supposed to protect us backfire...but they rarely have to. These harms aren't newsworthy in the way that breaches or ransomeware attacks are. Most of us don't speak up when security measures backfire because we blame ourselves. Stories of security backfiring lack the fear-inducing bogeymen that make ransomware and breaches great stores. These stories don't give readers the chance the feel moral superiority they might feel for organizations that underspend on security, or the schadenfreude we can feel for those that did and were compromised anyway. Security backfires one person at a time, and so the harms of any one incident lacking the scale required to be newsworthy[^cryptocurrency]. And, unlike breaches, service providers are not required to report security-induced losses. Though nearly all of us have suffered harm when security technologies backfire, the aggregate harm -- surely including many millions of lifetimes of lost memories and records -- is almost entirely unmeasured and invisible to society, and even to experts in the industry.

[^cryptocurrency]: Notable exceptions are when cryptocurrency holders lose the keys to millions of dollars in assets.

The harms hidden by security-induced losses are not unlike occupational deaths and injuries at the start of the industrial revolution, when the technological industrialists of the timed blamed these ‘accidents‘ on the victims (workers), when employers were not required to report them, and the media did not consider the individual deaths newsworthy. Security-induced losses are not unlike automotive deaths, which were initially unreported, uncounted, and which the media and technological industrialists of the time blamed on everyone but the cars they produced: initially drivers, until the bogeyman of the jaywalker was invented.

To grasp the severity of media capture in security tech, consider the analog of pharmaceuticals and imagine if The New York Times headlined an article [“Why You Need an Antidepressant. Yes, You”](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/27/smarter-living/wirecutter/why-you-need-a-password-manager-yes-you.html), headlined another [“The Best Antidepressants”](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-password-managers/), received a [commission](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/partners/) from the pharmaceutical industry on purchases, and only quoted sources from within the pharmaceutical industry. They might even do so while claiming to give unbiased advice because their writers are generally unaware of the referral commission a product earns, conveniently overlooking their bias in favor of an entire product category when commissions are ubiquitous within that category, ensuring the article will earn commissions now matter how the editorial staff ranks the products.[^wirecutter-total-editorial-independence]

[^wirecutter-total-editorial-independence]: The New York Times WireCutter [partnerships page](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/partners/) claims as ‘strict separation between Commerce and Editorial’ and the [about page](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/about/) claims ‘total editorial independence’, yet when content is funded by affiliate marketing, the mere choice to cover product categories is source of bias in and of itself. PCWorld, a product of IDG Communications Inc., claims ‘editorial independence’ because ‘our journalists are generally unaware of how much commission – if any – PCWorld receives from a purchase’, which also ignores the potential for bias in favor of an entire product category.

If you're unsure of whether affiliate links have led to media capture, consider the headlines of news articles that instructed their entire readership to use password managers. Lest readers think these products were for other people, The New York Times WireCutter's headline exhorted [“Why You Need a Password Manager. Yes, You”](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/27/smarter-living/wirecutter/why-you-need-a-password-manager-yes-you.html); CNET confirmed that [“Yes, You Need a Password Manager. Your Online Security Depends on It”](https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/yes-you-need-a-password-manager-your-online-security-depends-on-it/); Engadget agreed and added urgency with the headline [“You need a password manager -- right now”](https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-26-the-best-password-managers-compared.html); Wired chided [“Get a Password Manager. No More Excuses”](https://www.wired.com/story/password-manager-autofill-ad-tech-privacy/); and, finally, for those who might use the free password manager built into their browser in place of those with affiliate links, PCWorld explained [“Why your browser’s password manager isn’t good enough”](https://www.pcworld.com/article/393979/why-your-browsers-password-manager-isnt-good-enough.html) in 2021, recommending LastPass as ‘Best Overall’.

A breach of LastPass in 2022 exposed online databases of users' passwords. Some of the data were not encrypted, and the passwords were encrypted by keys from a substandard, dated, and insecurely configured key-derivation function.[^lastpass-iterations] LastPass had one of the largest shares of the market, if not *the* largest.[^lastpass-market-share]  The final [SEC Form 10-Q for the six months ending June 30, 2020 of LogMeIn](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001420302/000156459020034298/logm-10q_20200630.htm), the developer of LastPass, reported sales and marketing expenses of \$235.5 million, of which \$92.2 million were bucketed as marketing expenses separate from the sales and marketing personnel, professional services, credit card transaction fees, and so on (the other \$127.7 million). The SEC report does not break down these expenses between LogMeIn's flagship product (LastPass) and other products, and between affiliate commissions and direct advertising. Yet, even if LastPass commissions represented 10\% of that budget, it would mean that tens of millions of dollars flowed between this one product vendor and the media covering that vendor in the year before the breach alone.

[^lastpass-market-share]: In a 2021 [study](https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/37374029) I co-authored with collaborators at UC Berkeley, LastPass had the largest market share among verified participants.
