# Media Capture and the Hazards of Security Technologies and Products

When security tech backfires it can cause us devastating and irreparable harm. The same authentication measures that keep attackers out our online accounts can lock us out, effectively destroying decades of photos, correspondence, and records. When a phone requires a PIN to unlock a navigation app, or restore its access to location data, while we are driving on the highway, it creates the risk of a crash. Even temporary losses of access can cause permanent harm, such as we are prevented from accessing important medical data before emergency treatment, from reaching out to those we trust when we need them most, or from being reached by others when they need us most. The potential for harm from the technology that purports to protect us grows as we grow ever more reliant on technology to unlock the world around us and help us navigate it.

Yet the industry that sells and promotes security technologies presents security as a tradeoff between harm and *inconvenience*, implying that nobody is harmed when security backfires. Thus, these harms need not be measured or reported, and those unwilling to adopt ever-stricter security should be portrayed as irresponsible. The industry has captured the press to promote and amplify this narrative.

To grasp the severity of the problem consider the analog of pharmaceuticals. Imagine if The New York Times headlined articles titled [‘Why You Need an Antidepressant. Yes, You’](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/27/smarter-living/wirecutter/why-you-need-a-password-manager-yes-you.html) and [‘The Best Antidepressants’](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-password-managers/), only quoted sources from within the pharmaceutical industry, and received a commission when readers bought antidepressants via links in the article. Replace *antidepressant* with *password manager* and *pharmaceutical* with *tech* and you have the state of media capture today.

Indeed, The New York Times WireCutter's has carried an article with the headline imploring[‘Why You Need a Password Manager. Yes, You’](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/27/smarter-living/wirecutter/why-you-need-a-password-manager-yes-you.html); CNET with [‘Yes, You Need a Password Manager. Your Online Security Depends on It’](https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/yes-you-need-a-password-manager-your-online-security-depends-on-it/); Engadget has urged [‘You need a password manager -- right now’](https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-26-the-best-password-managers-compared.html); Wired has chided [‘Get a Password Manager. No More Excuses’](https://www.wired.com/story/password-manager-autofill-ad-tech-privacy/); and, lastly, in 2021, PCWorld exhorted to those who might use the free password manager built into their browser in place of those with affiliate links [‘Why your browser’s password manager isn’t good enough’](https://www.pcworld.com/article/393979/why-your-browsers-password-manager-isnt-good-enough.html), recommending LastPass as ‘Best Overall’.

These recommendations were not harmless. LastPass had one of the largest shares of the market, if not *the* largest[^lastpass-market-share], and  breach of LastPass in 2022 exposed online databases of users' passwords. Some of the data were not encrypted, and the passwords were encrypted by keys derived from customers' passwords using a substandard, dated, and insecurely configured key-derivation function.[^lastpass-iterations] Yet, the media coverage did not mention the likely millions, or tens of millions of dollars that flowed from the industry to the press that had recommended these products.[^money-flow]

[^money-flow]: The final [SEC Form 10-Q for the six months ending June 30, 2020 of LogMeIn](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001420302/000156459020034298/logm-10q_20200630.htm), the developer of LastPass, reported sales and marketing expenses of \$235.5 million, of which \$92.2 million were bucketed as marketing expenses separate from the sales and marketing personnel, professional services, credit card transaction fees, and so on (the other \$127.7 million). The SEC report does not break down these expenses between LogMeIn's flagship LastPass and other products, and between affiliate commissions and direct advertising. Yet, even if LastPass commissions represented 10\% of that budget, it would mean that over ten million dollars flowed between this one product vendor and the media covering that vendor in the year before the breach alone.

[^lastpass-market-share]: In a 2021 [study](https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/37374029) I co-authored with collaborators at UC Berkeley, LastPass had the largest market share among verified participants.

[^lastpass-iterations]: See Wladimir Palant's [LastPass breach: The significance of these password iterations](https://palant.info/2022/12/28/lastpass-breach-the-significance-of-these-password-iterations/), 2022-12-28

The media covering this industry disingenuously asserts that affiliate programs do not bias coverage because writers are “generally unaware” of the referral commission earned from each product. Indeed, when every product pays a commission, affiliate programs need not influence which product from the category they rank as ‘the best’. Rather, the bias is in the choice to recommend the entire product category.[^editorial-independence]

[^editorial-independence]: The New York Times WireCutter [partnerships page](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/partners/) claims a “strict separation between Commerce and Editorial” and the [about page](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/about/) claims “total editorial independence”. PCWorld, a product of IDG Communications Inc., claims “editorial independence” because [“Our journalists are generally unaware of how much commission – if any – PCWorld receives from a purchase.”](https://www.pcworld.com/about/affiliate-link-policy).

The LastPass breach was somewhat unusual, and thus newsworthy, because a product that purported to defend against attack was exploited by attackers. It was in no way unique, as antivirus products have also introduced security flaws that adversaries have exploited. The lack of reflection by the media for recommending categories of security products that opened up customers to new attacks by adversaries shows what a large challenge it is that they will reckon with harms that are not caused by adversaries, but by the technologies backfiring against users.

The great majority of harmful events caused by security products are not when they open up new avenues of attack, but when they backfire against users. These events not newsworthy, especially when compared to more attention-grabbing security stories like breaches and ransomware. Stories of losing data when security backfires lack the fear-inducing bogeymen that make ransomware and breaches great stores. Stories of security backfiring don't give readers the chance the feel moral superiority they might feel for organizations that underspend on security, or the schadenfreude we can feel for those that did and were compromised anyway. Security backfires one person at a time, and so the harms of any one incident lacking the scale required to be newsworthy[^cryptocurrency]. And, unlike breaches, service providers are not required to report when data lose but not breached. Most of us don't speak up when security measures backfire because we blame ourselves. Though nearly all of us have suffered harm when security technologies backfire, the aggregate harm -- surely including many millions of lifetimes of lost memories and records -- is almost entirely unmeasured and invisible to society, and even to experts in the industry.

<!-- The tech industry would readily fault us for the harms we face when the security measures that are supposed to protect us backfire...but they rarely have to. -->

[^cryptocurrency]: Notable exceptions are when cryptocurrency holders lose the keys to millions of dollars in assets.

The harms hidden by security-induced losses are not unlike occupational deaths and injuries at the start of the industrial revolution, when the technological industrialists of the timed blamed these ‘accidents‘ on the victims (workers), when employers were not required to report them, and the media did not consider the individual deaths newsworthy. Security-induced losses are not unlike automotive deaths, which were initially unreported, uncounted, and which the media and technological industrialists of the time blamed on everyone but the cars they produced: initially drivers, until the bogeyman of the jaywalker was invented.
