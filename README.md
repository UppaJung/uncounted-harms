# How Harms are Hidden when Security Technologies Backfire

Security technologies can cause devastating and irreparable harms when they backfire.

Security technologies can cause us to lose precious assets, such as decades of records, photos, correspondence, and contacts, such as when authentication systems permanently lock us out of online accounts or encrypted file systems. They can put our lives at risk, such as when our phone's security features lock us out of navigation while we are driving on the highway and require us to re-enter a PIN or scan our face.[^locked-navigation]  As we become every more reliant on technology, losing access to it even briefly can cause harm; imagine being unable to access medical data before emergency treatment, from being blocked from reaching out to those you trust when you need them most, or from unreachable by others when they need you most.

Lost human connection and relationships -->


Yet the technology industry presents security as a tradeoff between harm and *inconvenience*, implying that nobody is truly harmed when security backfires. They portray those unwilling to adopt ever-stricter security as irresponsible. The tech industry has captured the press to promote and amplify this narrative. In doing so, they have ensured that the harms when security technologies backfire are rarely reported. Instead, we hear only attention-grabbing security stories like breaches and ransomware, and the narrative that more security is always better.

Though nearly all of us have suffered harm when security technologies backfire, the aggregate harm – surely including many millions of lifetimes of lost memories, lost records, lost work, lost opportunities, and severed relationships – is almost entirely invisible to society. Most of us don't report or speak up when the security measures mean to protect us backfire because we blame ourselves. Since losses occur one person at a time, few incidents are large enough to be newsworthy[^cryptocurrency]. And, unlike breaches, service providers are not required to report when accounts or data are lost but not exposed to attackers. Because these harms go unmeasured and uncounted, even experts can only guess at their scale. We can infer the scale is vast because stories of loss are ubiquitous.

History tells us that immense harm can hide in plain site under similar conditions. For example, at the start of the industrial revolution, occupational deaths and injuries were rarely reported and went uncounted. The technological industrialists of the time blamed these ‘accidents‘ on the victims (workers), employers were not required to report them, and the media did not consider the individual deaths newsworthy. The deaths and injuries resulting from automotive crashes were also initially unreported and uncounted. The technological industrialists of the time blamed these harms everyone but the cars they produced: initially drivers, until the bogeyman of the jaywalker was invented.[^no-accidents]

To address the harms when security technologies backfire, we must ensure these harms are reported and counted, as we require for other hazardous products. We need researchers to measure the prevalence of harms and their impact, and aggregate those losses over the affected populations. We need investigators to continue to track losses longitudinally (over time) even though such work is harder to fund, publish, and attract media attention to. In the long-term, we may require tech companies to track and report the harms when security backfires as they do when security is breached. More radically, we might even want to require certain classes of security tech to be independently tested for potential harms before deployment, as we do for other hazardous products.


[^locked-navigation]: This example is not hypothetical or dated. The security features in my 2023 phone have silently removed the Google Maps app's access to my location while it was navigating me on a highway, and locked the app entirely during other drives. This backfire occurred even though the navigation app (Google Maps), and car integration system (Android Auto) were all made by the same organization as the phone's operating system (Google's Android), which are presumably tested to work together.

[^cryptocurrency]: Notable exceptions are when cryptocurrency holders lose the keys to millions of dollars in assets.


[^no-accidents]: For a history of deaths and injuries from industrial work and automotive crashes were once uncounted and invisible, I recommend [Jessie Singer](https://jessiesinger.com/)'s 2022 book [“There Are No Accidents”](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/There-Are-No-Accidents/Jessie-Singer/9781797139241).
