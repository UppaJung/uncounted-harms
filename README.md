# Media Capture and the Hazards of Security Products

When security products and features backfire they can cause us devastating and irreparable harm. When we are locked out of online or encrypted storage, we can permanently lose decades of photos, correspondence, and records. Even temporary denials of access can cause permanent harm, such as when they prevent us from sharing important medical data before emergency treatment, from reaching out to those we trust when we need them most, or from being reached by others when they need us most. The potential for harm grows ss we grow ever more reliant on technology to unlock the world around us and help us navigate it.

Yet the tech industry presents security as a tradeoff between harm and inconvenience: where stricter security prevents harms at the cost of mere *inconvenience*. The language implies that those unwilling to make this tradeoff are irresponsible, even when the costs are unmeasured and unknown. The industry has captured the press to promote and amplify this narrative.

The tech industry would readily fault us for the harms we face when the security measures that are supposed to protect us backfire...but they rarely have to. These harms aren't newsworthy in the way that breaches or ransomeware attacks are. Most of us don't speak up when security measures backfire because we blame ourselves. Stories of security backfiring lack the fear-inducing bogeymen that make ransomware and breaches great stores. These stories don't give readers the chance the feel moral superiority they might feel for organizations that underspend on security, or the schadenfreude we can feel for those that did and were compromised anyway. Security backfires one person at a time, and so the harms of any one incident lacking the scale required to be newsworthy[^cryptocurrency]. And, unlike breaches, service providers are not required to report security-induced losses. Though nearly all of us have suffered harm when security technologies backfire, the aggregate harm -- surely including many millions of lifetimes of lost memories and records -- is almost entirely unmeasured and invisible to society, and even to experts in the industry.

[^cryptocurrency]: Notable exceptions are when cryptocurrency holders lose the keys to millions of dollars in assets.

The harms hidden by security-induced losses are not unlike occupational deaths and injuries at the start of the industrial revolution, when the technological industrialists of the timed blamed these ‘accidents‘ on the victims (workers), when employers were not required to report them, and the media did not consider the individual deaths newsworthy. Security-induced losses are not unlike automotive deaths, which were initially unreported, uncounted, and which the media and technological industrialists of the time blamed on everyone but the cars they produced: initially drivers, until the bogeyman of the jaywalker was invented.

When I read media coverage of security products, it is as if they are covering experimental pharmaceuticals with the sole caveat that popping pills twice is an inconvenience, with no mention of side effects, with quotes exclusively from those working in the pharmaceutical industry, and with affiliate links. News outlets can proudly tout being unbiased in their recommendations, because they make money no matter which you choose. The bias is in recommending the product category, and they do so shamelessly.[^titles]
