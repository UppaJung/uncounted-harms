# Media Capture and the Hazards of Security Products

Security products and features can cause us devastating and irreparable harm when they backfire. We can permanently lose decades of photos, correspondence, and records when locked out of online services or encrypted storage. Even temporary security barriers can cause long-term harm if we cannot access important medical data when needing treatment, reach out to those we trust in emergencies, or become unreachable when others may need us most. The potential for harm grows ss we grow ever more reliant on technology to unlock the world around us and help us navigate it.

Yet the tech industry has successfully sold the narrative that security is tradeoff between harm and convenience: the only harms to fear are those that security is introduced to prevent; the consequences when security backfires can be dismissed as mere inconveniences; and any responsible person should eagerly embrace these inconveniences to be better protected from attacks. The industry has captured the press to promote and amplify this narrative.

The tech industry would readily fault us for the security-induced harms that befall us...but they rarely have to. Unlike breaches or ransomeware attacks, security-induced harms aren't newsworthy. Most of us don't speak up when we are harmed because we blame ourselves, accepting the narrative that we were in control of the security technology that harmed us and should have done more to prevent it. Not that the press would be interested. Security-induced losses lack the fear-inducing bogeymen behind ransomware and breaches. They lack moral superiority we can feel over school districts that refused to spend 5-10 teacher salaries for a security hire, or the schadenfreude we can feel for the security hire they did spend those salaries on. Security-induced losses occur one person at a time, lacking the scale required to be newsworthy[^cryptocurrency]. And, unlike breaches, service providers are not required to report security-induced losses, so the problem is hidden. Though nearly all of us have suffered harm when security technologies backfire, the aggregate harm -- surely including many millions of lifetimes of lost memories and records -- is almost entirely invisible to society.

[^cryptocurrency]: Notable exceptions are when cryptocurrency holders lose the keys to millions of dollars in assets.

The harms hidden by security-induced losses are not unlike occupational deaths and injuries at the start of the industrial revolution, when the technological industrialists of the timed blamed these ‘accidents‘ on the victims (workers), when employers were not required to report them, and the media did not consider the individual deaths newsworthy. Security-induced losses are not unlike automotive deaths, which were initially unreported, uncounted, and which the technological industrialists of the time blamed on everyone but themselves and the cars they produced (initially drivers, until the bogeyman of the jaywalker was invented). Again, the media followed the industrialists narrative.

When I read media coverage of security products, it is as if they are covering experimental medications by explaining product designers are frustrated that consumers would prefer to risk disease than face the mere inconvenience of popping two pills each day, with no mention of potential side effects.
