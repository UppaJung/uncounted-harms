When I read press coverage of security products, they seem It's as if the choice to take an experimental medications was a tradeoff between preventing the harms of a disease vs. the inconvenience popping pills twice a day.

The same was once true of industrial accidents, car accidents, and medicine.

[^cryptocurrency]: Notable exceptions are when cryptocurrency holders lose the keys to millions of dollars in assets.

 - losses don't feature an attacker or 
 - security backfires one person at a time, and so loss events lack the human scale of breaches or ransomeware attacks
 - security-induced losses are considered accidents, with their cause attributed to their victims, and so there's no bogeyman to expose or moral lesson
 - 
 - 
 - there are no reporting requirements security-induced losses, so they aren't reported




 allow them 
They question the public's reluctance to adopt technologies as 



No regulatory capture, because there's no regulation. If anything, regulators aid security companies by requiring adoption of unproven security. Media Capture, with the press regularly reminding users how bad we are, and that products can save us, often with no discussion of the harms of these products.

When security technologies backfire, we may forever lose access to decades of photos, or work, or we may be temporarily lose access to time-critical information such travel credentials, key medical records, emergency contacts, or something as mundane but career-changing as presentation slides. Most of us have suffered both permanent data losses and suffered due to temporary losses of access.

Yet, the unintended harms of security technologies are underappreciated, under-reported, and even outright ignored fo much the same reason that industrial injuries, car crashes, and medical side effects once were.

- The harms occur one at a time, to individuals, rather than in events of enough scale to make the news (like when millions of accounts are breached).
- The harms are blamed on victims not doing more to prevent them, and not the design of the technologies themselves. (Whereas, again, breaches are harder to blame on the victims.)
- There's no reporting requirement for losses when accounts are forever locked out. (there are for breaches)
- Because we are made to feel at fault for our losses, we are embarrassed to talk about them.
- There's no adversary or bogeyman to frighten us into action
- Falsely perceived as in our control
- Minimized as 'inconvenience'
- 
- It's easy to blame the victim (should have backed up)
- Losses are hard to quantify in meaningful terms (how much is a month of photos worth?)

Security is not an inconvenience. It causes HARM.
Most everyone who uses technology is harmed and losses are everywhere.

1. Society is increasingly recognizing the technology products are hazardous, in part because of security risks.



1. Security products escape scrutiny for much the same reason as medicine once did: people were so desperate for cures that they assumed the risk of side effects.

### Key points

- Computing devices and online services are hazardous products.
- Security technologies are themselves hazardous products. Like medicines, there is dangerous pressure to ignore their potential harms because we need them to remediate other harms. But every security safeguard has potential harm.
- Until we recognize loss (deletion, temporary and permanent denial of access) as a harm to be tracked, problems will be under-reported and unaddressed

Loss is undervalued because


Contrast that with breaches, which has evil villains, is outside our control, occurs in mass, and often has dollar outcomes. Oh, and we have breach reporting requirements.



We are over-focused on breaches because they are (1) big and (2) reported.  Losses happen one at a time.  Most of us have lost data. (I"ve lost email history when my university email account was closed without warning, a Google Account for my daughter, at least one Microsoft account. I lost photos when locked out of a phone before I could back them up.  My music collection.)


"At the end of the day, it's a free account"

Since people do pay for add-ons like more storage, what they actually mean is "At the end of the day, the potential loss to us is too small for us to care about."

Hazardous products. (if the risks aren't known, they can't be required to disclose them.)

But unlike deaths from medicines, these losses aren't reported.  (Much like industrial accidents once were not reported.)

There's nothing we can do about the nut behind the wheel has been replaced with "there's nothing we can do about the nut behind the keyboard."

Deploying FIDO tokens to the home because they work in the enterprise is like deploying IV bags to the home because they work in the hospital, dispensing medication even when the patient is left alone in their room.

Google, Apple, & Microsoft, don't report accidents (loss).
Nor do social networks.
Password managers don't report accidents.
TOTP companies (authy) don't report accidents
Companies that make 
End-to-end encryption is making it worse (even though reporting is possible)

Temporary losses (no access when immediately needed) and permanent loss.  The former sounds harmless, but it may not be (needing your passport photo, emergency medical information, an important presentation)

Our industry invents endless jargon to warn of attacks (spear phishing, credential stuffing, ) and justify deploying new security technologies, but we have no common language about their harm.

The only required accidents reported are breaches.

Termination
   (0) logins/use stops, no request to recovery

Loss:
   (0) logins stop
   (1) there are 1 or more requests to recover, none of which succeed

Theft:
   (0) there is a request to recover
   (1) logins continue
   (2) request to recover is escalated to human



Account recovery requests must be reported.
   (0) total requests to recovery account
   (1) the number that complete (the requestor is given access to the account and re-establishes use)
   (2) the number that half-complete (the requestor is offered access but re-establishment not complete within N days)
   (3) the number that believed fraudulent
   (4) the number that are inconclusive, but the account is not activated again within N days
   (5) the number that complete, but with data loss (e.g., losing E2E data)
   (1) number reported invalid by someone able to access the account

   (x) Known compromises.


I've lost
- My wedding presentation (FileVault encrypted storage failure in 2002)
- Photos destroyed due to security on Windows Phone (5 lockouts, actually a bug)
- A daughter's Google account (deleted after 6 months of disuse for security reasons), it was disused after she switched to iOS, but we still had security reset emails going there.
- Email accounts (Hotmail, backup email was university account that access was removed to without my knowledge)
- Conversations lost when switching devices with E2E messengers (Signal, WhatsApp)
- Lost business contacts when locked out of WeChat (phone number changed)

- Accounts that 
- FIGMA designs (associated with expired email account)
- All my grad school files (an admin deleted them without telling me)
- My music collection of 100s of CDs I had converted to MP3s (I uploaded it to a cloud service, assumed it was still there, when it wasn't)
